## Chess Implementation

### Chess.cpp
- Contains implementation of the 8x8 game board and pawn moves. Currently uses iterative generation for moves instead of bitboards. Will likely change everything to bitboards after understanding how everything works in the iteration way first.
- Note: Generates pieces from bottom left to the top right, also reversed the FEN string because I think white should be on the bottom of the board.
